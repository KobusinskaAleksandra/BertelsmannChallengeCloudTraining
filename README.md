Training repository for Bertelsmann Challenge Cloud

Welcome to my repository that will help us train our GIT skills!
Let's start!


1. Let's see how many of us is there
<br>a) fork the repository
<br>b) go to your GitHub profile
<br>c) clone the repository to your local drive
<br>d) go to folder called "logo" (maybe using terminal?)
<br>e) copy there your own logo (funny picture, gif, whatever you want!) - please, for identification reasons, name it NAME_OF_YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT-YOUR_NAME_ON_SLACK
<br>f) create commit, telling what you did and push the changes to repository
<br>!g) go back to main (this) repository on authors account and create pull request (probably that won't work automatically, then just let me know to add you as a contributor - my logín on Slack is @Ola)

<br><br>START!
