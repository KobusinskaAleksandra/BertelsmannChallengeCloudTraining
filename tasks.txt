## Task 2 ##

	a) Clone the original repository (not the fork one)
	b) Create new local branch, name it as you want, just make sure this name doesn't exist yet
	c) Checkout your new branch
	d) Inside "task2-branches" folder create text file and write something inside
	e) Commit changes and push your new branch to ORIGINAL repository (you should have access by now)
	f) Once you pushed your changes, open the text file again and write some more things inside
	g) Don't commit or push last change! We will use it to create merge conflict
	h) Let me know when you're done and you have new local changes in your file. I will push other changes there and let's try to deal with merge conflict!
